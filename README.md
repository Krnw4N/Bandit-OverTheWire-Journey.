My personal documentation and journey through OverTheWire Bandit wargame to master Linux CLI.
## 🧠 My Struggles & Breakthroughs

### Level 0 -> 1: The Beginning
**My Confusion:** Honestly, I was completely lost at first. I didn't even know how to connect to the server! After watching some tutorials and asking AI, I realized it was simpler than I thought. But once I was in, I got confused again. Instead of thinking it through, I took the "instant way" by asking AI for the answers. It turned out to be basic commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `find`. The funniest part? Once I found the password, I didn't even know how to use it to log in to the next level. And yes, I had to ask AI again. Haha! 😅

### Level 1 -> 2: The "Dashed" Filename
**My Confusion:** My logic started to kick in here. I began to feel comfortable with the terminal and basic commands. It didn't take long to find the solution, and I felt genuinely happy because, for the first time, I solved it entirely on my own!

### Level 2 -> 3: Spaces Everywhere
**My Confusion:** I felt faster and more "skilled," but this level hit me with a reality check. I tried `ls`, `cd`, and `find`, but nothing worked. I got stuck and went back to my "AI mentor." Turns out, it was just a simple matter of using quotation marks `""`. This is where I realized I was still quite naive, but man, it was getting fun!

### Level 3 -> 4: The Invisible File
**My Confusion:** This one was a breeze! Even though I wandered around the directories for a bit, my favorite command `find` came to the rescue. It didn't take long before I typed `cat ./inhere/...Hiding-From-You` and BOOM—password found!

### Level 4 -> 5: Data Overload
**My Confusion:** I was completely stuck. I tried searching YouTube, but couldn't find anything specific for my situation. I looked up relevant commands from the OverTheWire hints, but I still couldn't get it. After being stuck for almost an hour, I felt "buntu" (at a dead end) and asked AI again. I was surprised to find that the answer used the same old commands, just with a slightly different implementation. From this level on, I promised myself to stop relying on AI for instant answers and start building my own logic.
